# No Style Portfolio

<https://no-style-portfolio.vercel.app/>

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio that contains most useful information, while minimizing file size (so the page loads as fast as possible).

## Commit history and size of deployment

The only two things that get deployed are the `index.html` and the `styles.css`. To calculate the size of both files I simply check the Vercel deployment logs

Here is an overview of the commit history from earliest commit to latest commit

| Commit date                    | Commit hash                              | Total file size | Change     |
