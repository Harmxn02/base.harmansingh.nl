# No Style Portfolio

<https://no-style-portfolio.vercel.app/>

## Goal

The goal of this project is to create a portfolio that contains most useful information, while minimizing file size (so the page loads as fast as possible).

## Commit history and size of deployment

The only two things that get deployed are the `index.html` and the `styles.css`. To calculate the size of both files I simply check the Vercel deployment logs. Commit messages will contain the file size as shown in File Explorer (because I need to commit and deploy the changes to see the deployment's size, and I cannot change the commit message after pushing), but below are the actual deployment sizes.

Here is an overview of the commits which will alter the deployment size, from earliest commit to latest commit

| Commit date                    | Commit hash                                                                                                                                | Deployment size | Change     |
